# Data structure
Data structures are like the bones and muscles of any good program.Here we going through some data structures by using Python


<h2>What is Data structure</h2>
   The collection of organized data in memory location is called a Data Structure
<br>


**💡 Data Structure = Organized data+Allowed operations 💡**



<h2>Types of Data structure</h2>
<h4>1. Primitive Data structures </h4>

<p>Primitive Data structures are directly supported by the language ie; any operation is directly performed in these data items.Which have single memory location and which hold single value only
Ex: integer, Character, Real numbers etc.</p>

<h4>2. Non Primitive Data structures </h4>

<p>Non-primitive data types are not defined by the programming language, but are instead created by the programmer</p>

<h2>Non-primitive are Two</h2>
<h4>1. Linear data structures</h4>

<p>A data structure that includes data elements stored or arranged sequentially or linearly or have a order, where each element is connected to its previous and next nearest elements, is referred to as a linear data structure.Arrays and linked lists are two examples of linear data structures.</p>
<h4>2. Non Linear data structures</h4>

<p>Non-linear data structures are data structures in which data elements are not arranged linearly or sequentially. We cannot walk through all elements in one pass in a non-linear data structure, as in a linear data structure.Trees and graphs are two examples of non-linear data structures</p>

### Common Operations on the Data Structures

1. init — initialization(add)
2. Set 
3. Get
4. Traverse
5. Insert 
6. Delete
7. Searching
8. Sorting

## Python Data structures

**Build-in DS**

- **List** (in python we use list insead of array)
- **Tuple**
- **Set**
- **Dictionary**
- **String**

**User Difined**

- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Linked List**
- **Tree**
- **Graph**


> **When we do a program, knowing only the data structure is not enough, we also need to know the algorithms,Because**
>
**💡  Algorithm + Data Structure = Program 💡**

# Algorithms

### What is Algorithms

- An algorithm is a Step By Step process to solve a problem, where each step indicates an intermediate task. Algorithm contains finite number of steps that leads to the solution of the problem.

### Categories of Algorithm

Based on the different types of steps in an Algorithm, it can be divided into three
categories, namely

1. Sequence
2. Selection
3. Iteration

> **When apply a Algorithm in a DS How to find the most effective solution to a given problem from multiple solutions? 
It is thorough Complexity Analysis**
>
### Complexity Analysis of Algorithm

How to find the most effective solution to a given problem from multiple solutions? It is through complexity analysis. **Complexity analysis** is defined as a technique to measure how long an algorithm would take to complete given an `input` of size `n`.

### **The Efficiency of an Algorithm can be measured by the following metrics.**

1. Time Complexity analysis.
2. Space Complexity analysis.

**💡 here ideal case is use less space in less time 💡**

> **Sometimes time takes a lot and space takes less but sometimes time takes less and space takes more. So How to analysis those complexity.we can calcualate time and space complixity through `Asymptotic analysis`**
>

# Asymptotic analysis

Asymptotic analysis is a method of analyzing the performance of algorithms.it defining the mathematical boundation/framing of its run-time performance. Using asymptotic analysis, we can very well conclude the best case, average case, and worst case scenario of an algorithm.

There are three primary types of asymptotic notation used in asymptotic analysis

### Asymptotic Notations

1. **Ο Notation**
2. **Ω Notation**
3. **θ Notation**

### Types of Analysis

- **Worst Case Running Time**

The worst case running time of an algorithm is an upper bound on the running time for any input.Knowing it gives us a guarantee that the algorithm will never take any longer. For expressing worst case running time of an algorithm **Big O notation** is used.

- **Best Case Running Time**

The best case running time of an algorithm is lower bound on the running time for any input. The best rarely occurs in practice. For expressing best case running time of an algorithm **Big Ω notation** is used.

- **Average Case Running Time**

The average case running time of an algorithm is an estimate of the running time for an “average input”. For expressing average case running time of an algorithm **Big Ɵ notation** is used.
